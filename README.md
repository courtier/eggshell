### Lightweight (and probably brittle) JSON based database

Inspired by scribble, aims to be better than it, at least for my usages

### To-Do (in order of priority):
- [X] Insert document
- [X] Read all documents in collection
- [X] Delete collection
- [X] Read all documents matching a parameter
- [ ] Delete all documents matching a parameter
- [ ] Edit document matching a parameter
- [ ] Edit all documents matching a parameter
- [ ] Encryption (will slow down the processes)
- [ ] Indexing using Snowflake IDs
- [ ] Logging

### Features:
- [X] Supports windows (i think)
